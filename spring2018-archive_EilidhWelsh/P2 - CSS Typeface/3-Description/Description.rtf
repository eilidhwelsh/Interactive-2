\f0\fs24 \cf0 For my typeface, I modeled it after a high contrast serif typeface. Since some parts of letters are really thin I decided to get rid of those strokes creating fragments of each letter. The typeface is called Security because the letters can be tough to decipher to those who are unfamiliar with them as well as the \'92S\'92 being modeled after a recording button for security videos. So, this typeface is for the person who likes to stay off the grid while still having some form of human contact. It allows those who use it to have a bit more privacy since it takes more than just one glance to understand the message. The typeface also inverts the color because it is easier to read the type when it is white on black rather than black on white, while following the off the grid concept it allows those who are familiar with this typeface to have an upper hand since it becomes easier to read. }
