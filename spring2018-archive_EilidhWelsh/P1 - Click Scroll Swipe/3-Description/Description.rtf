\f0\fs24 \cf0 With this project I expanded on the click function, in the 50 Result Charrette I enjoyed coding the click function because it let me hide gifs within some buttons so I built on that and created a click function for matching different halves of fruit. There wasn\'92t much of a concept for this as the other ones I just like illustrating fruit and cutting them in half to randomize the order and force people to match them. }
